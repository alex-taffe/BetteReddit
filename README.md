## About
This app is a fully featured Reddit client built for macOS. It is currently not ready for production so things most likely will not work. It is written in Objective C.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install`. Then, rename `config-example.plist` to `config.plist` and fill in your Reddit client ID.

## Requirements
- Xcode 9.0
- ARC
